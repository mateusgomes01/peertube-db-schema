## About peertube
PeerTube is a free and open-source, decentralized, federated video platform powered by ActivityPub and WebTorrent, that uses peer-to-peer technology to reduce load on individual servers when viewing videos. Started in 2017 by a programmer known as Chocobozzz, development of PeerTube is now supported by the French non-profit Framasoft. The aim is to provide an alternative to centralized platforms such as YouTube, Vimeo, and Dailymotion. (source: wikipedia)

## About EERCase

### What is EERCase?
The Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) Model is one of the most used modeling languages for the conceptual design of database. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no metamodels and Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool that provide support to code generation and schema validation from conceptual data model according to the EER classical notation (i.e., Chen/Elmasri and Navathe's notation -  cf. Fig below). Aiming to overcome the previous shortcoming, we have proposed a metamodel and a CASE tool named EER MetaModel (EERMM) and EERCASE, respectively.
